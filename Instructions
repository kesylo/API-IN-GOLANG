Some instructions to get started

- Install redis server
- You mainly have to edit the routes.go file. Don't remove any methods. Just add yours
- Add your API to the API folder
- You need to create an html page in the templates folder (mine is facts.html) that will display your API
- I also put some git commands in the Git file at the root to help. I have created a branch for you already called "Avni". just select that
  branch and start working on it.
- If you have css a integer, put it in static with the other css
- install  go get -u github.com/tidwall/gjson
